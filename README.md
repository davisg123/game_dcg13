Mirror Man
====

First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2014

###About

Started August 28th, completed September 4th.  Total time: 8 hours.
Project Author: Davis Gossage
Used the Brick Breaker sample game as a starting point, no code was used from there.

The javaFX Hello World project was the file that was used to start this project.

Thoughts on the project: really enjoyed it, I loved the freedom involved with being able to create a game from scratch.

###Genre
Puzzle Game

###GamePlay
Drag anywhere in the play area to generate a laser.  This laser reflects off of any mirror.  Mirrors can be dragged around the screen.  The goal is to have the laser hit the target (which looks like a door).  The laser changes color when it hits a mirror.  The color of the laser must match the color of the target to win the level.

###Cheat Code
Press 'S' on any level to view the winning mirror configuration.

###Back Story
Mirror Man has been trapped for as long as he can remember.  He travels through rooms, each one containing a locked colored door and several colored mirrors.  Mirror Man opens a door by arranging the mirrors around the room and then shooting his lazer gun at a correct angle to cause the correctly colored beam of light to hit the door and allow him to enter the next room.

###Goal
The goal of the game is to arrange a series of colored mirrors around a 2d room in order to allow a correctly colored beam of light to hit a button, allowing entrance to the next room.  


###Mechanics
Drag mirrors around the map and click on Mirror Man to point and shoot his lazer gun.  Because Mirror Man is viewing the mirror room from outside, only mirrors can be moved around, Mirror Man himself is immobile (as diagrammed).  When the correctly colored beam of light hits the button, Mirror Man can move on to the next level.

###Level System
Levels in this game differ by what color or how many mirrors are given to the user, what angles the mirrors are restricted to, and what color the target is.  Varying those properties can lead to infinitely unique levels.
