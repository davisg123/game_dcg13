Mirror Man
====

First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2014

###Genre
Puzzle Game

###Back Story
Mirror Man has been trapped for as long as he can remember.  He travels through rooms, each one containing a locked colored door and several colored mirrors.  Mirror Man opens a door by arranging the mirrors around the room and then shooting his lazer gun at a correct angle to cause the correctly colored beam of light to hit the door and allow him to enter the next room.

###Goal
The goal of the game is to arrange a series of colored mirrors around a 2d room in order to allow a correctly colored beam of light to hit a button, allowing entrance to the next room.  


###Mechanics
Drag mirrors around the map and click on Mirror Man to point and shoot his lazer gun.  Because Mirror Man is viewing the mirror room from outside, only mirrors can be moved around, Mirror Man himself is immobile (as diagrammed).  When the correctly colored beam of light hits the button, Mirror Man can move on to the next level.

###Level System
Levels in this game differ by what color or how many mirrors are given to the user, what angles the mirrors are restricted to, and what color the target is.  Varying those properties can lead to infinitely unique levels.
